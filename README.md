Comparing Normal, Asthma and Emphysema Respiratory Responses


## **1. Introduction**

This document describes the modelling and simulation of human lung mechanics using MATLAB Simulink. **Distributed** models are investigated to analyse respiratory behaviour under normal and pathological conditions such as **asthma** and **emphysema**. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effect of varying physiological parameters—such as airway resistance and lung/chest wall compliance—on airflow, pressure, and lung volume.

## **2. Lumped vs Distributed Lung Models**

### **2.1 Lumped Model**

A lumped lung model simplifies the entire respiratory system into a single compartment. In this approach:

* The lung is represented using a single **resistance–compliance (R–C)** structure.
* Airflow and pressure are assumed to be **uniform** throughout the lung.
* The model is mathematically simple and computationally efficient.
* It is suitable for basic respiratory simulation and introductory physiological studies.

### **2.2 Distributed Model**

A distributed model divides the lung into **multiple interconnected compartments**, each with its own resistance and compliance. This approach:

* Captures **regional variations** in airflow and pressure.
* Provides a more **realistic representation** of lung physiology.
* Allows simulation of diseases affecting specific lung regions.
* Requires more computational resources due to increased complexity.

| Computational effort         | Low                | Moderate to High      |
| Structural representation    | Single compartment | Multiple compartments |

## **3. Analogy Between Model Parameters and Human Physiology**

| Model Parameter                | Physiological Equivalent                       | Interpretation in Human Body                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rp (Airway Resistance)**     | Bronchial airway diameter, mucus obstruction   | Higher Rp indicates obstructed airflow, characteristic of asthma.         |
| **Cw (Chest Wall Compliance)** | Flexibility of chest wall and thoracic tissues | Lower Cw corresponds to stiff chest walls, seen in emphysema or fibrosis. |
| **Cl (Lung Compliance)**       | Elasticity of alveolar tissue                  | Reduced Cl indicates stiff lungs; increased Cl indicates hyperinflation.  |
| **Flow Input (Q)**             | Breathing effort by respiratory muscles        | Represents inhalation and exhalation rates generated by the diaphragm.    |
| **Pressure Output**            | Alveolar and pleural pressure                  | Reflects lung inflation and recoil behaviour.                             |
| **Volume Integrator**          | Tidal volume accumulation                      | Tracks the amount of air entering the lungs per breath.                   |

## **4. Distributed Lung Model Implementation**

The distributed model is implemented using Simulink components corresponding to resistive and compliant elements of the respiratory system. The baseline parameters represent normal lung physiology. Graphical block diagrams illustrate airflow pathways and pressure interactions across compartments.

## **5. Simulation of Normal Lung Condition**

Under healthy physiological conditions, airflow, pressure, and lung volume follow smooth, periodic sinusoidal patterns. The simulation results show stable tidal volume and consistent breathing cycles.

## **6. Asthma Condition Simulation**

### **6.1 Parameter Modification**

* Airway resistance **Rp** increased to **7.5** to mimic airway narrowing.

### **6.2 Physiological Interpretation**

* Increased resistance restricts airflow.
* Breathing becomes laboured, and pressure differentials increase.
* Amplitude of airflow waveform decreases.

## **7. Emphysema Condition Simulation**

### **7.1 Parameter Modification**

* Chest wall compliance **Cw** reduced to **0.4**.

### **7.2 Physiological Interpretation**

* Reduced compliance represents stiffened lung tissues.
* Changes in pressure–volume behaviour cause reduced elastic recoil.
* Output waveform reflects altered breathing dynamics.

## **8. Simulation Procedure**

1. Open MATLAB and launch Simulink.
2. Import the provided model files (`.slx`).
3. Set the simulation time (e.g., 0–10 seconds).
4. Click **Run** to simulate.
5. Use the **Scope** block to visualise airflow, pressure, and volume.
6. For exporting data, use the **To Workspace** block and plot using MATLAB commands.

Example:

```matlab
plot(flow.time, flow.signals.values);
```

## **9. Conclusion**

The study demonstrates that distributed lung models provide a more detailed and physiologically accurate representation of respiratory mechanics compared to lumped models. Variations in airway resistance and compliance significantly affect airflow, pressure, and tidal volume. Disease-specific simulations (asthma and emphysema) align with known clinical behaviour—supporting the validity of the model.

This analysis highlights how lung mechanics change under pathological conditions and reinforces the importance of resistance and compliance in determining respiratory function.
